# Contributing to ARIA-superpowers

Thanks for your interest! This is a curated collection — not all PRs will be merged, but all ideas are welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

### Request a skill
Open a [Skill Request issue](../../issues/new?template=skill-request.yml). Describe the use case and an example prompt.

### Report a bug
Open a [Bug Report issue](../../issues/new?template=bug-report.yml).

### Share your own skills
Use [Discussions](../../discussions) to share skills you've written. Others can use them directly even if they're not merged here.

### Submit a PR
PRs are welcome for:
- Bug fixes in existing skills
- New skills that are broadly useful (not project-specific)
- Improvements to docs or the skill browser

PRs must follow the format in [SKILL_SPEC.md](SKILL_SPEC.md).

## Review Process

This repo is maintained by one person. PRs may take time to review. Not every skill fits — the bar is: "would most Claude Code users benefit from this?"

## Code of Conduct

Be kind. This is a small open-source project made in spare time.
